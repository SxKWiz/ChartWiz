# Trade Monitoring Feature - Continuous Trade Management

## Overview

The Trade Monitoring feature is an advanced AI-powered system that automatically switches from trade detection to continuous trade monitoring once a trade opportunity is found. It provides real-time updates on trade progress, risk management, and exit recommendations until the user manually stops monitoring.

## Key Features

### üîÑ Automatic Mode Switching
- **Detection Mode**: AI scans for new trade opportunities
- **Monitoring Mode**: Once a trade is detected, automatically switches to monitoring that specific trade
- **No Interference**: Stops detecting new trades while monitoring an active trade
- **Manual Control**: User can stop monitoring and return to detection mode

### üìä Real-Time Trade Updates

- **Risk Assessment**: Dynamic risk level evaluation
- **Position Status**: Profitable, breakeven, losing, or at risk
- **Take Profit Progress**: Progress towards each profit target

### üéØ Smart Recommendations
- **HOLD**: Trade progressing well, no action needed
- **PARTIAL_EXIT**: Take some profits, reduce risk
- **FULL_EXIT**: Close entire position due to risk or target reached
- **MOVE_STOP_LOSS**: Adjust stop loss for better risk management
- **ADD_POSITION**: Increase position size if setup improves

### ‚ö° Urgency Levels
